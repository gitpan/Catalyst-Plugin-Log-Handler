NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Handler - Catalyst Plugin for Log::Handler

VERSION

Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    use Catalyst qw(Log::Handler);

Catalyst configuration (e. g. in YAML format):

    Log::Handler:
        filename: /var/log/myapp.log
        fileopen: 1
        mode: append
        newline: 1

DESCRIPTION

If your Catalyst project logs many messages, logging via standard error to
Apache's error log is not very clean: The log messages are mixed with other web
applications' noise; and especially if you use mod_fastcgi, every line will be
prepended with a long prefix.

An alternative is logging to a file.  But then you have to make sure that
multiple processes won't corrupt the log file.  The module Log::Handler by
Jonny Schulz does exactly this, because it supports message-wise flocking.

This module is a wrapper for said Log::Handler.
