        Log::Handler (LH) has been using the name is_debug rather than
        would_log_debug etc. since version 0.33.  Log::Handler 0.38 won't have
        would_log_* for downwards compatibility any more, so I have to change
        Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Handler (CPLH).

        NB: CPLH   0.07 requires LH >= 0.33
            CPLH < 0.07 requires LH <= 0.37

        Added new tests to check that is_* methods can be called.

0.05    Apr 25 22:21:11 CEST 2007
        Removed pm_to_blib, which was accidentally added.

0.04    Apr 25 18:17:17 CEST 2007
        * Make the "handler" method public
        * Fix dependencies
        * Add a new test

0.03    Apr 25 13:25:00 CEST 2007
        Map Catalyst's "warn" to Log::Handler's "warning".  Previously it was
        mapped to "warn", but that didn't exist in Log::Handler.

0.02    Apr 25 12:23:00 CEST 2007
        Fixed some dependencies.

0.01    Apr 25 01:00:00 CEST 2007
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
